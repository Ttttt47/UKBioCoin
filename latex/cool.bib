	abstract = {In recent years, a number of large-scale genome-wide association studies have been published for human traits adjusted for other correlated traits with a genetic basis. In most studies, the motivation for such an adjustment is to discover genetic variants associated with the primary outcome independently of the correlated trait. In this report, we contend that this objective is fulfilled when the tested variants have no effect on the covariate or when the correlation between the covariate and the outcome is fully explained by a direct effect of the covariate on the outcome. For all other scenarios, an unintended bias is introduced with respect to the primary outcome as a result of the adjustment, and this bias might lead to false positives. Here, we illustrate this point by providing examples from published genome-wide association studies, including large meta-analysis of waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference adjusted for body mass index (BMI), where genetic effects might be biased as a result of adjustment for body mass index. Using both theory and simulations, we explore this phenomenon in detail and discuss the ramifications for future genome-wide association studies of correlated traits and diseases.},

	abstract = {Heritability, the proportion of variation in a trait that can be explained by genetic variation, is an important parameter in efforts to understand the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes as well as in the design and interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Attempts to understand the heritability of complex phenotypes attributable to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation data has motivated the analysis of large datasets as well as the development of sophisticated tools to estimate heritability in these datasets. Linear mixed models (LMMs) have emerged as a key tool for heritability estimation where the parameters of the LMMs, i.e. the variance components, are related to the heritability attributable to the SNPs analyzed. Likelihood-based inference in LMMs, however, poses serious computational burdens.We propose a scalable randomized algorithm for estimating variance components in LMMs. Our method is based on a method-of-moment estimator that has a runtime complexity O(NMB) for N individuals and M SNPs (where B is a parameter that controls the number of random matrix-vector multiplications). Further, by leveraging the structure of the genotype matrix, we can reduce the time complexity to O(NMBmax( log⁡3N, log⁡3M)).We demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our method on simulated as well as on empirical data. On standard hardware, our method computes heritability on a dataset of 500 000 individuals and 100 000 SNPs in 38 min.The RHE-reg software is made freely available to the research community at: https://github.com/sriramlab/RHE-reg.},

	abstract = {Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading, despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies. Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures. The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study, that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of modifiable exposures.},
